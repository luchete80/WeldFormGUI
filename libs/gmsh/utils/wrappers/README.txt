This directory contains swig wrappers for the private Gmsh API. These are not
actively maintained anymore and are mostly provided for backward compatibility.
For new projects you should use the public Gmsh API instead (see gmsh/api),
which natively supports (without swig) C++, C, Python, Julia and Fortran.
